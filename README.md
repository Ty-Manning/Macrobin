# MacroBin

**MacroBin** is a fork of the excellent [MicroBin](https://github.com/szabodanika/microbin) by D치niel Szab칩. It retains all the core features of MicroBin while introducing several enhancements and changes.

This version adds support for:

* Markdown styling for pastas.
* 4 animal names per pasta instead of 3 for increased variety.
* `/api` endpoints for programmatic generation of pastas.

Check out MacroBin at macrobin.co

## Features (Inherited from MicroBin)

* Entirely self-contained executable
* Server-side and client-side encryption
* File uploads (e.g. `server.com/file/pig-dog-cat-emu`)
* Raw text serving (e.g. `server.com/raw/pig-dog-cat-emu`)
* Animal names instead of random numbers for upload identifiers (64 animals)
* SQLite and JSON database support
* Private and public, editable and uneditable, automatically and never expiring uploads
* Automatic dark mode and custom styling support with very little CSS and only vanilla JS (see [`water.css`](https://github.com/kognise/water.css))
* And much more!

## What is an upload?

In MicroBin (and thus MacroBin), an upload can be:

* A text that you want to paste from one machine to another, e.g. some code,
* A file that you want to share, e.g. a video that is too large for Discord, a zip with a code project in it or an image,
* A URL redirection.

## When is MicroBin/MacroBin useful?

You can use MicroBin/MacroBin:

* To send long texts to other people,
* To send large files to other people,
* To share secrets or sensitive documents securely,
* As a URL shortener/redirect service,
* To serve content on the web, eg . configuration files for testing, images, or any other file content using the Raw functionality,
* To move files between your desktop and a server you access from the console,
* As a "postbox" service where people can upload their files or texts, but they cannot see or remove what others sent you,
* Or even to take quick notes.

...and many other things, why not get creative?
